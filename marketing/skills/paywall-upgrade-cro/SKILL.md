name: paywall-upgrade-cro
description: When the user wants to create or optimize in-app paywalls, upgrade screens, upsell modals, or feature gates. Also use when the user mentions "paywall," "upgrade screen," "upgrade modal," "upsell," "feature gate," "convert free to paid," "freemium conversion," "trial expiration screen," "limit reached screen," "plan upgrade prompt," "in-app pricing," "free users won't upgrade," "trial to paid conversion," or "how do I get users to pay." Use this for any in-product moment where you're asking users to upgrade. Distinct from public pricing pages (see page-cro) — this focuses on in-product upgrade moments where the user has already experienced value. For pricing decisions, see pricing-strategy.

- Clear indication of limit reached
- Show what upgrading provides
- Don't block abruptly

### Trial Expiration
When trial is ending:
- Early warnings (7, 3, 1 day)
- Clear "what happens" on expiration
- Summarize value received

### Time-Based Prompts
After X days of free use:
- Gentle upgrade reminder
- Highlight unused paid features
- Easy to dismiss

2. **Value Demonstration** - Preview, before/after, "With Pro you could..."

3. **Feature Comparison** - Highlight key differences, current plan marked

4. **Pricing** - Clear, simple, annual vs. monthly options

5. **Social Proof** - Customer quotes, "X teams use this"

6. **CTA** - Specific and value-oriented: "Start Getting [Benefit]"

7. **Escape Hatch** - Clear "Not now" or "Continue with Free"
